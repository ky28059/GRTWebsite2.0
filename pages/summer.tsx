            <div className="flex flex-col gap-3 mb-8">
                <Question name="When is the camp? How long are camp sessions?">
                    We're running two sessions of the camp, one during the week of June 12th and the second during the
                    week of June 19th. Each session consists of 5 days (Monday through Friday), and each day runs from
                    9am to 3pm. On the registration form, students can select which session they'd prefer -- both sessions
                    cover the same content.
                </Question>
                <Question name="What will my student learn?">
                    We'll be teaching students to build a robot for competition, covering every aspect from designing to programming. 
                    Through interactive lessons in the first portion of camp, students will build robots to tackle some challenges
                    we've prepared. Then, students will work with their teams to develop a robot to compete in our final camp
                    game (a friendly competition)! This structure resembles GRT's preparation and competition season.
                </Question>
                <Question name="Who are the instructors?">
                    All instructors are students on the Gunn Robotics Team. Our team consists of current sophomores,
                    juniors, and seniors, each bringing a unique skill to the summer camp team. Instructors have a wide
                    range of experiences, from animation and electronics to programming and mechanical design.
                </Question>
                <Question name="What will my student need?">
                    Students do not need prior experience! During the camp itself, students will need a laptop with a USB port and
                    the ability to connect to the internet. If bringing such a device is a difficulty for you and your student, please 
                    reach out to us at <a href="mailto:gunnrobotics192@gmail.com">gunnrobotics192@gmail.com</a>!
                </Question>
                <Question name="Is the camp in-person?">
                    Yes! The camp will be held in-person in GRT's shop at Gunn High School.
                </Question>
                <Question name="Will lunch be provided?">
                    Lunch will not be provided. Students should bring their own lunch. Snacks will be provided.
                </Question>
                <Question name="What is the price?">
                    No payment is required for our summer camp, but we would greatly appreciate a donation of any amount (recommended 
                    $400) to help us cover costs and keep our team running year after year. Please send donations to our PayPal
