                The Gunn Robotics Team (GRT) is both a team and a class, and members must be concurrently enrolled in
                the Engineering Technology course. GRT and the Engineering Technology course is open to all sophomores,
                juniors and seniors at Gunn High School. No specific prior knowledge or classes are required for acceptance
                as the team requires a variety of skills. However, engineering classes offered at Gunn such as Introduction
                to Engineering Design or Principles of Engineering would teach skills directly applicable to robot design.
                Members are expected to put in time and effort during and outside of school hours. This includes fund-raising
                activities and community outreach events. During build season, from early January to late February, each
                member is expected to spend at least 8-12 hours a week outside of school (after-school, evenings, and
                weekends) working on the robot and/or other team tasks. Applicants with many extra-curricular activities
                or time restraints should keep this in mind before applying.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium text-center mb-6">Applying for the team</h3>
            <p className="font-light mb-10">
                Applications to join the team are available in the robotics shop (L-5) or the guidance office in late
                January. Applications may include segments and prompts such as a personal statement, short responses,
                and creativity challenges. The selection process for the team is competitive and applicants should have
                other elective choices in case they are not accepted into the team. It is recommended to pick up the
                forms as early as they are available, to allow adequate time to thoughtfully complete the responses.
